// Variable naming conventions are rules on how to name variables, 
// such as using meaningful names, avoiding special characters, 
// and following certain patterns to make your code clear and easy to maintain.

let userAge = 25;        // Good: meaningful, follows camelCase
let totalAmount = 1000;  // Good: meaningful, follows camelCase
let $price = 500;        // Valid, but avoid overuse of special characters
let _isActive = true;    // Valid, but use with care
